#### Installation instructions are here:

**IMPORTANT**: The cloud API I built is in ALPHA phase. It is not production ready yet. I will be upgrading the code as time permits to add things like authentication, state saving, and other features. It also may crash, since I've only tested it with one MiLight bridge (mine). Don't expect much. If you want to contribute to this project, I need help with the SmartThings code. The source is available on the github repo. Please fork it and submit a pull request when ready.

Bug reports: Please submit on Github, the logs, and what version of the device code you are using.

A big thank you to all the gurus on the SmartThings forums who laid the groundwork before me.

It will be updated as the project matures. You should be able to add it with SmartThings github integration, and update as I update the master branch.
